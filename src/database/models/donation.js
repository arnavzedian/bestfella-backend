//data.$** is not supported for search index
//there are two kinds of searches $text search and search inside aggregation
//$search be aggregation is really powerful as it is powered by mongoDB 4.2 full text search released in 2019
//It is the fourth tab in atlas
///read doc here: https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/atlas-search/
//fields are string because mongoose can't allow putting dollar sign
